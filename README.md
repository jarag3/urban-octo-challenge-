# Description 
This challenge consists of refactoring both the .html and .css file to meet a certain set of standards. More importanly, for accessibility reasons. The .hmtl file had too many non-semantic elements so it was refactored to to the correct semantic elements. Issues came up after adding these semantic elements therefore modifying the css file was needed. The CSS selectors were changed to properly link the elements used in .html. I added accessible alt attributes to its respected positions and also added a proper Title. Comments were also added to both the .html and .css file.
